    <p class="text">
      I have experience as a technical specialist. I started studying Frontend
      development from scratch in 2021. The successful graduation of the
      TeachMeSkills courses gave me the opportunity to try myself in a new field
      for me. My current goal is to take RS School courses and improve my
      skills.
